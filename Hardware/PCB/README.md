# ACIDUINO PCB
I have created a PCB that can build an aciduino by midilab as a bare board device.
It would be easy to build with less number parts!
Please refer to midilab page for more details and code.

# BOM List

* 1x arduino nano
* 6x 220ohms resistors
* 6x 6mm taticle switch
* 6x 3mm diffused leds
* 4x 10k linear potentiometers
* MIDI Connector[like this](http://modularanalog.com/?product=midi-jack-5-pin-din-pcb-mount)

！！ Note ！！
- We built one that we ordered from a PCB manufacturing company in China. It is working well.
- A hole is provided to connect a 9V battery box.
- It also works with power supplied from the Arduino's USB port.
