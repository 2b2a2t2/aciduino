# ACIDUINO PCB
I have created a PCB that can build an aciduino by midilab as a bare board device.
It would be easy to build with less number parts!
Please refer to the folder hierarchy above for the code.
(Be sure to use the latest firmware!)

# About Fabrication
You can get the PCB by submitting the "aciduino_gerber.zip" to a PCB fabrication company in China.
It's usually a lot of 5 pieces.

# BOM List

* 1x arduino nano
* 10x 220ohms resistors
* 1x 4.7kohms resistors
* 1x 1N4148 diodes
* 1x 6N138 optocoupler
* 6x Key switches(If you don't like that, you can substitute a 6mm taticle switch)
* 6x 3mm diffused leds
* 4x 10k linear potentiometers
* 2xMIDI Connector[like this](http://modularanalog.com/?product=midi-jack-5-pin-din-pcb-mount)

!! Additional !!
- A hole is provided to connect a 9V battery box.
- It also works with power supplied from the Arduino's USB port.
