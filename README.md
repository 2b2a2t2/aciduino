# Aciduino

Cheap, DIY Roland TB303/TR808 Step Sequencer clone aimed for live interaction. Your acid lines for a very low cost on arduino platform.

There are two flavors of aciduino, the first version is a TB303 sequencer only, the second one is a TB303 and TR808 sequencer with oled display and step grid system.

You can do it in 1 hour on your protoboard or order a PCB.

## Aciduino V1

TB-303 only sequencer.

## Aciduino V2

TB-303 and TR-808 sequencer with Oled. The modular design allows you to extend it with more knobs or buttons/leds on another protoboard.

Aciduino v2 brings new acid elements such as 808 step sequencer and a generative engine based on euclidian algorithm for great acid drums ideas.

A oled screen to get access to all parameters that matters in realtime, a easy to edit grid system for 808 and 303.
