# Aciduino

Cheap Roland TB303/TR808 Step Sequencer clone aimed for live interaction. Your acid lines for a very low cost on arduino platform.

There are two flavors of aciduino, the first version is a TB303 sequencer only, the second one is a TB303 and TR808 sequencer with oled display and step grid system.

Aciduino v2 brings new acid elements such as 808 step sequencer and a generative engine based on euclidian algorithm for great acid drums ideas.

A oled screen to get access to all parameters that matters in realtime, a easy to edit grid system for 808 and 303.

# Features

## 303 Step Sequencer clone
Programming using rest, tie, glide and accent on each step. The addition of step length parameter per track makes you able to choose from 1 step to 16 steps of pattern length to make some unsual sequences.

## Generative Engine
Generate automatic harmonized acid lines by pressing a single button and twist some harmonic parameter knobs. Just pick up a harmonic mode(scale), the low and high notes to fit the sequence and you have infinite sequences by pressing random it button!

## Midi Controller
Controls your synthetizer acid midi parameters per track up to 6 parameters.

## Midi Clock
Tight and solid MIDI clock to drive your gears clock needs or receive midi sync signal.
